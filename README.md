README FOR ASSIGNMENT 8

So what I've done includes just the basic fulfilling of the requirements. I haven't impleneted the login and authentication process yet, but I was successfully able to get my frontend to display my Supabase tables data. What I struggled with most was that I needed to use not the public key like Ethan had in his tutorial video. Currently I'm in the middle of implementing the authentication and login frontend and connecting it to the backend, I believe my backend has pretty much all the capababilities, I just need to update my front-end.
